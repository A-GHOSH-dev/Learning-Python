'''Roman Letters
The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the late Middle Ages. Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters as shown below:

Given a letter in Roman numeral, develop an algorithm and write the Python code to print the value of it. If some other letter other than Roman numeral is given as input then print ‘Enter a roman numeral’ and terminate.
